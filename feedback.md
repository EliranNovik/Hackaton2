Hi Eliran,
Your idea is great, and the final result is impressive. You've successfully structured your project and incorporated all the topics and features we've covered in class.
Here are a couple of suggestions for future improvements:
-Database: Currently, you're using pgAdmin to manage your data. I advise you to use Neon, a public database that can be accessed from any computer if you have the right credentials. 
 For now, I cannot access your database because it is local, which means I cannot run your project. 
 If you want to submit a project managed by pgAdmin, you need to have a file that will create all the tables needed and insert the data needed every time you run the server by using the "IF NOT EXISTS" method.
-GitIgnore: In your .gitignore file, you are referring only to your .env file. 
 First, you need to pay attention also to the node_modules and the package-lock.json. 
 Second, the file is not executing your demand, so now everyone can see your credentials, and that is not ideal.
Keep up the excellent work!
